crussh: a modern cssh replacement
=================================

Backstory
---------

For anyone who needs to administrate clusters of many machines,
[clusterssh](http://sourceforge.net/projects/clusterssh/) has long been a
fallback for when the rest of your automation tools aren't working.

However, cssh has a number of deficiencies in modern environments:

- Doesn't play nice with window placement of modern window managers.
- Doesn't play nice with modern toolkits' copy and paste behaviour.
- Gets a bit screwy when there's more terminals than can fit on-screen.
- Doesn't support nice antialiased fonts.

crussh aims to be a simple replacement for cssh that corrects these
problems. It does so with the following features:

- Uses a single window to hold multiple terminals.
- Intelligently tiles terminals to fit available window size.
- Scrolls available terminals when they don't all fit in-window.
- Never resizes a terminal smaller than 80x24 characters.
- Uses GTK and the VTE widget to provide modern, anti-aliased terminals.

Install
-------

The install process is very simple on most distros:

- Install python2, python-gtk2, and python-vte.
- Run ./crussh.py HOST [HOST ...]
